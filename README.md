# CS231n
Here's my view of **Assignments** for **[CS231n 2021](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)**, and also useful **papers** recommanded. 

The Slides of the course can be visited at **[Slides](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/)**.

The (2017 version)course can be learned at **[Course](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nJ411z7fe)**.

## Experience
As it is completed in my freshman year, when I am no so familiar with Python and some packages/libraries (especially **numpy** and **torch**), so sometimes it is challenging for me to accomplish the tasks and I have to look for help. 

Thanks to other open coursed projects on **GitHub([1](https://github.com/Divsigma/2020-cs213n/tree/master/cs231n), [2](https://github.com/zhuole1025/cs231n), [3](https://github.com/bingcheng1998/CS231n-2020-spring-assignment-solution))** and lots of good blogs on **CSDN**, I learn how to code with a clear and concise style and get a deep insight into the field of CV and DL. 

From starting to learn the first course, to finally accomplishing all the sheets, it takes about 2 months.
